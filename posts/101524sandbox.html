                        I never thought I’d be writing this. If you had asked me before joining MIT where I saw myself, I would have confidently said, "finance." I’d spent years preparing for a career in private equity, ready to dive deeper into that world, analyzing investments, driving value, and mastering the art of deal-making. Entrepreneurship was never the plan. It seemed too risky, too uncertain—an adventure for other people, but not me. Yet here I am, writing as the founder and CEO of a rising digital health company, Health+, and I owe so much of this unexpected and rewarding journey to MIT Sandbox.
                    </p>
                        Looking back, MIT Sandbox was the catalyst I didn’t know I needed. It wasn't just the financial support or access to mentors; it was the shift in mindset that made me believe entrepreneurship was possible for me. The resources provided by Sandbox—mentors, office hours, workshops, funding, and most importantly, the inspiring entrepreneurs I’ve met—gave me the confidence to explore an unfamiliar path. More importantly, it helped me realize that starting a company didn’t mean walking away from the expertise I had built in finance. Instead, I found a way to merge my skills with my passion for mental health, building something meaningful in the process.

                        <b>The Mentorship: A Guiding Hand in Uncharted Territory</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the first things Sandbox offers is access to an incredible network of mentors. These aren’t just business coaches; they’re seasoned entrepreneurs and industry experts who have walked the same rocky road you’re about to embark on. My mentor at Sandbox wasn’t just there for advice but for encouragement during moments of doubt. I can recall a specific moment when I was knee-deep in product development, feeling completely overwhelmed, wondering if I should just return to the comfortable, familiar world of private equity. My mentor’s words were simple but impactful: “Maria, entrepreneurship isn’t about avoiding uncertainty, it’s about navigating it.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those words have stuck with me ever since. Sandbox mentors helped me map out the landscape, from product-market fit to understanding the intricacies of scaling a business. They gave me the tools to manage risk in ways I hadn’t considered before.

                        <b>Office Hours: An Invaluable Resource</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I cannot emphasize enough how useful the weekly office hours were. They felt like mini think tanks where you could drop in, brainstorm, or just vent. For someone like me who was used to a structured corporate environment, the freedom to explore ideas with experienced entrepreneurs in these sessions was incredibly refreshing. I found solutions to challenges I didn’t even know I had—like how to effectively pitch to potential investors or structure my early-stage team for maximum efficiency.

                        <b>Sandbox Grants: Fuel for the Vision</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, of course, there’s the financial support. Sandbox offers grants that allow students like me to take those critical first steps without the immediate pressure of seeking venture capital. This funding gave me the runway to build Health+ from a mere concept to a viable product without sacrificing my vision. Sandbox’s belief in my idea—before anyone else did—was invaluable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Events & Workshops: Building Community and Confidence</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s easy to feel isolated as a founder, especially when things aren’t going as planned. But Sandbox’s regular events and workshops foster a sense of community that makes you realize you’re not alone. The workshops helped me refine my business acumen, from financial modeling to marketing strategies, while the events were perfect for networking. I met so many other students who, like me, were unsure about this whole “entrepreneurship thing,” but were open to learning and exploring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These workshops are designed to not just teach you the mechanics of starting a business but to inspire you to think bigger, to be more innovative. I walked away from every session feeling both more capable and more motivated.

                        The Power of Connections and Entrepreneurial Inspiration
                    </b></p>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps one of the most surprising gifts of the Sandbox experience has been the connections I’ve made with other entrepreneurs. There’s something deeply powerful about being surrounded by people who share your drive and vision. Some of these individuals have become lifelong friends, while others have opened doors for me that I couldn’t have accessed otherwise. The entrepreneurial spirit at MIT is contagious, and the entrepreneurs I’ve met through Sandbox were constantly challenging me to push boundaries and think beyond my initial ideas. Their success stories became sources of inspiration, reminding me that the impossible is often just a few brave steps away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I still remember sitting at a Sandbox event, listening to a fellow founder recount the struggles and triumphs of building a company from scratch. Their raw honesty about failure and persistence fueled my own resolve. And the connections I’ve made—whether through introductions by mentors or informal chats at events—have been some of the most precious resources I’ve gained. These people are not just entrepreneurs; they are innovators, dreamers, and problem-solvers who have become part of my support system.

                    <p><b>Introspection and Gratitude</b></p>
                    <p>
                        When I think about my journey, it’s hard to imagine how different it would be if I hadn’t taken that first step into MIT Sandbox. I didn’t enter MIT with the intention of becoming an entrepreneur. In fact, there were many moments where I wondered if I was just delaying the inevitable return to private equity. But Sandbox changed my perspective. It gave me the courage to take a risk, to believe in my ability to build something new, and to harness the skills I had already honed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m profoundly grateful for Sandbox not just for helping me start Health+, but for showing me that entrepreneurship wasn’t an “either/or” decision. It wasn’t about leaving behind one career for another. It was about finding a way to bring all of my experiences together to create something meaningful.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>To Those Who Are Unsure: Just Try It</b></p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re reading this and unsure whether entrepreneurship is for you, I encourage you to take that leap. You don’t have to have all the answers, and you don’t need to know if this is the path for you. Sandbox is there to guide you, to support you with the resources you need, whether that’s mentorship, funding, or a community of like-minded individuals. Even if you end up not pursuing entrepreneurship long-term, the lessons you’ll learn in the process will be invaluable no matter where your career takes you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MIT Sandbox opened doors I didn’t even know existed. It provided me with the tools, the confidence, and the community I needed to take a chance on myself and my ideas. I couldn’t be more grateful, and I can’t wait to see where this journey continues to lead. So, to anyone who’s even remotely curious—just give Sandbox a shot. You might surprise yourself, just like I did.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thank you, MIT Sandbox, for making this journey possible.</p>
